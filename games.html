                "Pokémon Unite" is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game developed by TiMi Studio Group and published by The Pokémon Company and Nintendo. In this game, players form teams of five and compete against each other in strategic battles. Each player controls a Pokémon, which evolves and gains new abilities as the match progresses. The primary objective is to score points by defeating wild Pokémon and opposing team members, then depositing the points into goals located on the battlefield. The team with the most points at the end of the match wins. The game features a variety of Pokémon, each with unique abilities and roles, such as Attacker, Defender, Speedster, Supporter, and All-Rounder. The game emphasizes teamwork and strategy, with players needing to coordinate their efforts to outmaneuver and outscore their opponents. It also includes elements of progression, where Pokémon can level up and evolve during the match, adding depth to the gameplay experience.
